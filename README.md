I've successfully executed a range of data analytics and visualization projects utilizing Python, PowerBI, and MySQL.

Notably, my Netflix Userbase analysis involved comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive model development using regressors such as Linear Regressor and Random Forest Regressor, offering valuable insights into user behavior and preferences. In the realm of SQL, I conducted a detailed analysis of retail data, exploring purchase details, product information, and customer demographics to inform strategic business decisions. Furthermore, my PowerBI project boasts an interactive dashboard, shedding light on employee attrition rates and providing a nuanced understanding of the contributing features, thereby facilitating effective workforce management.

These projects are just samples using available data to showcase my capabilities in the field."
